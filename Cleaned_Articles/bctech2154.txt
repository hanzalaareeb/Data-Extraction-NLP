Creating BI Dashboard Data Studio connecting BigQuery Creating Live Dashboard, Historical Dashboard companies. historical data companies, Linear Regression Modelling perform create Modelling Dashboard companies Data Studio. Exploratory Data Analysis companies Historical Data. Store Customer Account Report message lead phone lead basis, Script created deployed Heroku store Historical data companies Finally Create Data Studio Dashboard it. Creating Representation Dashboard Companies involves multiple Reports blending multiple data sources Big Query. >> Module 1: API Data Abstraction includes generation access token refresh token scope Google AdWord API authentication connecting Google LSA API. fetching data JSON format account based customer_id assigned API URL fetching data. Likewise generating script Handle data generation active accounts based customer id. >> Module 2: Data Imputation Storing Converting JSON data pandas data forming list data active accounts looping deriving attributes based handling missing inf values. Finally storing data Google Big Query database respective table accounts Bigquery API. >> Module 3: Data Storing BigQuery Notification Automation task automate notifications email Basecamp data transferred database basis deploying script Heroku Server setting time parameters based time zone. >> Module 4: Automation tools created till now: i. LSA_AccountReport_daily_BigQuery tool: Automation Account Report companies basis. Scheduling 1:00 Timezone. ii. LSA_AccountReport_Historical_API tool: Storing Historical Data companies Years till end date set. iii. Basecamp_lsa_automation: lsa data message format Campfire respective companies groups store lsa data combined companies Messageboard Campfire Automation Python Group Basecamp. iv. LSA_DateRange Tool: store missed data companies sets days months need. v. LSA_MainSheet_AutoUpdation tool: Auto updation sheet ‘LSA Client Lead’ Google Sheet. Data fetched basis list required auto update sheet companies entered store information company name, account id database name. vi. LSA_daily_CustomerReport tool: Created Store LSA Customer Report companies database ‘CustomerReport_PhoneLead’ & ‘CustomerReport_MessageLead’ basis. vii. Historical_LSA_CustomerReport tool: Created Store LSA Customer Report companies database ‘CustomerReport_PhoneLead’ & ‘CustomerReport_MessageLead’ storing historical data 2021. >> Module 5: Data Studio BI Dashboards Created: i. Historical Dashboard ii. Live Dashboard ii. Customer Report Dashboard iii. Modelling Report Dashboard iv.

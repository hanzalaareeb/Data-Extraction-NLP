Code Review Checklist Client:A leading marketing firm Industry Type:Marketing services & Consulting Services:Marketing consultant Organization Size:100+ Project ‘Population Community Survey America’ objective perform Data Abstraction, Data Structurization, Data Preprocessing, Data Cleaning, Combining Data years listed finally presenting insights data Exploratory Data Analysis. Project ‘Population Community Survey America’ task involved fetching json unformatted csv data numerous web links needed process data, handling nested JSON, data conversion JSON data dataframe, performing pandas operation feature selection structuring data. Concat data csv file handle missing mapping dataset finally perform data visualization exploratory data analysis. Module 1: Data Abstraction process data abstraction involves collecting data numerous web links 2005 2017 viewing data JSON viewer tree format. Module 2: Data Chunking Integration unable process data pandas performed data chunking chunksize 10000 rows time 2005 likewise performed years data till 2017 finally combined dataframes data 2005 2017. Module 3: Handling Complexity Nested Data & format Unformatted CSV Files Handling unformatted CSV proper comma separated format data formed. Dataframe produced merging years 2005 2017 lot nested JSON data attributes performed normalization nested Json forming new_columns naming based attributes key. 2.2.4 Module 4: Data Cleaning Preprocessing Involves handling missing value, contraction mapping dataset fill missing State_Zip_Code column, handling inf -inf dataset attributes forming column population_ratio based passing formula attributes. 2.2.5 Module 5: Data Analysis step involves forming correlation matrix understand relation numeric attributes. performed Exploratory Data Analysis correlated attributes understand pattern/relation them. completion Project provided: ● Jupyter Notebook ● Anaconda ● Notepad++ ● Sublime Text ● Brackets ● Python 3.4 ● JSON Viewer ● Python ● ETL Techniques ● Advanced Excel Formatting project ‘Population Community Survey America’ developed software model makes project quality, reliable cost effective. ● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model ● Project RAD Model model forming loop end start, project based prototyping specific planning. RAD model, attention paid planning priority development tasks. targets developing software span time. ● Advantages RAD Model: Changing requirements accommodated. Progress measured. Iteration time powerful RAD tools. Productivity fewer people time. Reduced development time. Increases reusability components. initial reviews occur. Encourages customer feedback. Integration beginning solves lot integration issues Database project, Google Drive Storing Transferring Data. Web Server Data Cleaning Filling Missing Values Data mapping dataset Data proper format dataset. Data Cleaning built pandas operations Missing Values, Ordering Data Columns, Data Formatting, Changing data types more. Filling remaining Missing Data columns Outer Join datasets Map Function Python.
